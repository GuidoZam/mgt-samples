# Sample for Microsoft Graph Toolkit and SharePoint Framework

## Summary

This sample demonstrates the integration of the Microsoft Graph Toolkit into a SharePoint webpart using [SharePoint Framework](https://aka.ms/spfx). This webpart uses React.

The [Microsoft Graph Toolkit (MGT)](https://aka.ms/mgt) library is a collection of authentication providers and UI components powered by Microsoft Graph.

The sample uses the library [@microsoft/mgt-react](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@microsoft/mgt-react) to simplify usage of [Microsoft Graph Toolkit (MGT)](https://aka.ms/mgt) web components in React. The library wraps all mgt components and exports them as React components.

The `@microsoft/mgt-sharepoint-provider` allows users to automatically being signed-in and acquire tokens to use with Microsoft Graph.
