# Getting Started with Create React App

This sample demonstrates the integration of the Microsoft Graph Toolkit into a fully functional React application using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

The sample uses the library [@microsoft/mgt-react](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@microsoft/mgt-react) to simplify usage of [Microsoft Graph Toolkit (mgt)](https://aka.ms/mgt) web components in React. The library wraps all mgt components and exports them as React components.

## Setting up this sample

1. Copy the `.env.sample` to its own `.env` file
1. Add your own values in the file for `REACT_APP_CLIENT_ID`
1. Install the dependencies with `npm install`

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
